            <p>I love to read books such as Harry Potter SERIES or some of Roald Dahl's books.Whenever I get free time I sit with a book and read for half an hour or so.I like the Harry Potter series the most.My mom recomended it while I was like 7 years old and I am yet to finish the 5th,6th and 7th parts.I also like to read encyclopedias and guiness record books. I also learn a lot of words and their meanings by studying books</section>
